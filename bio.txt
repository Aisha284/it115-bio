Hello, I'm Aisha Abdirizak, and currently a student in the year up. In this program, I am developing software development skills such as coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning how corporate America works and sharpening my communication, leadership, and adaptation skills. I completed my general associate's degree in high school and learned the higher up in academia I got the fewer faces similar to mine I saw it as my goal to close the opportunity divide gap in order to create equal playing fields for black Muslim women in tech.
